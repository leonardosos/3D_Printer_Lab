# port is the port number for the web server, where listens for incoming requests
# api_base_url is the base URL for the API Gateway, where the web server will send requests
#   -> the port should match the one used in the API Gateway service
#   -> the URL should point to the API Gateway service in your Docker network

### Look port_flowchart for port flowchart

api_gateway:
  #LEGIT: Docker with name "api-gateway" and port 8080
  base_url: "http://api-gateway:8080"

  #TRICK: Docker bypassing the api gateway and directly connecting to the priority queue manager
  #base_url: "http://priority-queue-manager:8090"
web:
  host: "0.0.0.0"
  port: 8000
