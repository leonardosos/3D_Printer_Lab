### Application Scenario  
**An automated lab involved in the production of 3D printed objects**

---

### Project Description  

The project idea has already been explained in general in the Project Proposal. In the following, a more detailed description related to the implementation will be discussed. To refresh the project goal, here is a short summary:

Inside an automated room, there are several 3D printers, each responsible for printing its own project. A robot (Cartesian manipulator) is present to unload all the printed elements. The room can manage anomalies such as overheating or fires through sensors installed on each printer and in the room itself. The working process is also autonomously decided. A human user can initiate print jobs through a web interface and monitor the situation in the room.

### Project Implementation  

The architecture is based on a **microservice** approach. Humans can interact with the system through a **GUI** that allows them to monitor information and act on the system. In particular, the user interface communicates via **HTTP** protocol with various microservices, coordinated by an **API Gateway** which redirects requests appropriately.

The **API Gateway** can retrieve information from:
- **Global Temperatures (GT)**  
- **Printer Monitoring (PM)**  

These provide updates about the percentage of ongoing print jobs and the temperatures of both the printers and the room.

A complete **CRUD** interface is implemented in the **Priority Queue Management (PQM)** microservice, where print orders (files) are stored while waiting to be sent to the printers.

**GT** and **PM** support both **HTTP** and **MQTT** protocols.  
- **GT** subscribes to temperature topics (for the room and each printer) to inform the user and manage fan speed.  
- **Room temperature** is provided by a sensor.  
- **GT** publishes messages to the **Fan Controller (FC)**, which adjusts fan speed in case of overheating (of either a single printer or the room).  

**FC** also listens to anomalies detected by **Anomaly Detection (AT)**, which might implement a **machine learning model** to detect unexpected temperature behavior over time. In case of anomalies, the user is notified of possible malfunctions.

Returning to **PQM**, it sends files to be printed when requested by the **Job Handler (JH)** microservice.  
- **PQM** communicates only via **HTTP**.  
- **JH** is responsible for managing the printing process: sending files to available 3D printers and monitoring the printing status (e.g., percentage completed).  
- **JH** communicates via **MQTT** with **Robot Management (RM)**.

**Robot Management (RM)**:
- Listens for messages over a specific topic that alert when a print job is complete and the printer is ready to be unloaded.  
- Stores this information in a queue.  
- If the Cartesian robot is available, **coordinates** are sent so the robot can go to the printer, unload the object, and prepare the printer for a new job.

The **robot**, once it receives the coordinates, autonomously navigates to the target printer, collects the printed object, and updates **PM** and **JH** with its status for monitoring and coordination.
